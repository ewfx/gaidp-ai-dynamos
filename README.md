## 💡 Inspiration
The banking industry faces significant challenges in meeting compliance requirements due to the complexity and volume of financial transactions. Manual data profiling is inefficient, making it difficult to detect inconsistencies, risks, and violations. Inspired by the potential of AI to transform data analysis, we set out to build a scalable, explainable, and efficient system that automates regulatory data profiling, reduces human effort, and enhances accuracy.

## ⚙️ What It Does
- *Extracts data profiling rules* from regulatory reporting instructions using LLMs.
- *Performs anomaly detection* using unsupervised machine learning to validate data consistency.
- *Generates Python code* to validate data based on profiling rules.
- *Flags high-risk transactions* and suggests remediation actions, such as adjustments, explanations, or compliance steps.
- *Provides an interactive interface* for auditors to iteratively refine profiling rules.

## 🛠️ How We Built It
- *LLMs:* Hugging Face Transformers for processing regulatory reporting instructions.
- *Machine Learning:* Scikit-learn for anomaly detection, clustering, and risk scoring.
- *Data Processing:* Pandas and NumPy for handling structured financial data.
- *Code Generation:* ChatGPT for generating Python-based code.
- *Visualization & Interactivity:* React Tool for an intuitive interface that allows auditors to refine rules dynamically.

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced
- *Extracting accurate profiling rules:* Interpreting complex regulatory instructions required fine-tuning LLM prompts to extract meaningful validation rules.
- *Ensuring model explainability:* Regulatory compliance requires transparency, so we had to ensure that AI-generated rules and risk scores were interpretable by auditors.
- *Handling diverse transaction patterns:* Anomaly detection had to be adaptive to different banking scenarios without generating excessive false positives.
- *Building a scalable system:* The solution needed to handle large datasets efficiently while maintaining real-time performance. 

## 🏃 How to Run

### Overview
This project consists of:
- A **Python backend** running on Google Colab, utilizing Flask.
- A **Next.js frontend** for the user interface.
- **Ngrok** to expose the backend publicly.

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project.
---

### Backend Setup

1. Open the provided **Google Colab** notebook.
2. Run all the cells to start the backend service.
3. Once the backend is running, you will get the ngRok tunnel link as below :
   ```sh
   Public URL: NgrokTunnel: https://<ngrok-link>.ngrok-free.app
   ```
4. Copy the **public URL** generated by Ngrok. This will be used in the frontend.

---

### Frontend Setup
-Open this Link to launch the application : https://aidynamo.vercel.app/ else setup the code below :
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd <project-folder>
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the Next.js development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Run on browser:
   ```sh
   http://localhost:3000/
   ```

---

### Linking Frontend with Backend

1. Open the frontend application in the browser.
2. On the **top-right corner**, find the **Link Setup** option.
![14](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43b56715-884f-4cc2-94f1-da4d5b637c79)
4. Enter the **Ngrok tunnel URL** obtained from the backend.
5. Save the link, and the frontend will now communicate with the backend.

---

### Additional Notes
- Ensure that the backend remains active while using the frontend.
- If the backend restarts, a new Ngrok URL will be generated. Update the frontend accordingly.
